## Floatland Spawn
A Minetest mod that spawns players in the floatlands.
The only way to get down to the main world is by jumping off and falling, with a very high chance of dying!

Players are spawned in the floatlands, in a region 2000 nodes around x = 0, z = 0, on their first join, and when they die.
